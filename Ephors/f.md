### Project Summary

**Chief Cognitive Officer (CCO)** is an innovative tool designed specifically for vibe codersâ€”creative professionals who prefer hands-on coding over using virtual assistants or taking manual notes during meetings. The CCO integrates seamlessly with Zoom meetings via a widget, offering real-time tips to help users manage and close deals effectively. Post-meeting, users can access comprehensive meeting notes, a generated Product Requirements Document (PRD), and even a starter code repository within our app. The CCO can be personalized by integrating various data sources like Google Drive, Dropbox, Twitter, email, and calendars. Additionally, the platform allows other users to interview and hire vibe coders based on their CCO performance.
