**Project Summary**
The Chief Cognitive Officer (CCO) is an innovative tool designed for vibe coders who seek to streamline their workflow, enhance meeting productivity, and automate note-taking. By integrating a Zoom widget, the CCO provides real-time meeting management tips to help vibe coders close deals. Post-meeting, the CCO generates comprehensive meeting notes, a Product Requirements Document (PRD), and even initializes a code repository. The platform allows users to train their CCO by integrating various data sources, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Twitter, email, and calendar. Additionally, the CCO enables clients to find and hire suitable vibe coders for their projects by interviewing and evaluating "second brains" through the platform.

**User Stories**

1. **Vibe Coder**:
	* As a vibe coder, I want to add the CCO widget to my Zoom meetings so that I can receive real-time tips on managing the meeting and closing the deal.
	* As a vibe coder, I want to access the CCO app after the meeting to find generated meeting notes, PRD, and code repository, so that I can quickly start working on the project.
	* As a vibe coder, I want to train my CCO by integrating various data sources, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Twitter, email, and calendar, so that it can better understand my work style and preferences.
2. **Client**:
	* As a client, I want to log in to the CCO platform and interview "second brains" to find the best vibe coder for my project, so that I can ensure the right fit for my needs.
	* As a client, I want to hire a vibe coder through the CCO platform, so that I can streamline the hiring process and have access to a pool of qualified professionals.
3. **CCO Administrator**:
	* As a CCO administrator, I want to manage user accounts, data integrations, and platform settings, so that I can ensure the smooth operation of the platform.

**Technical Implementation**

1. **Zoom Widget**:
	* Develop a Zoom widget that makes requests to the CCO during meetings, using APIs such as Zoom's Webhook or API.
	* Implement real-time meeting management tips and deal-closing strategies using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms.
2. **CCO App**:
	* Design a user-friendly app that allows vibe coders to access meeting notes, PRD, and code repository after the meeting.
	* Implement data integration with Google Drive, Dropbox, Twitter, email, and calendar using APIs and OAuth.
	* Develop a machine learning model that analyzes user data and provides personalized recommendations for improving meeting productivity.
3. **Second Brain Evaluation**:
	* Develop a natural language processing (NLP) model that evaluates "second brains" based on their performance, skills, and experience.
	* Implement a rating system that allows clients to evaluate and hire vibe coders based on their performance.
4. **Platform Infrastructure**:
	* Design a scalable and secure platform infrastructure using cloud services such as AWS or Google Cloud.
	* Implement user authentication and authorization using OAuth and JWT.

**Design Aesthetic**

1. **Color Scheme**:
	* Primary color: #3498db (a calming blue)
	* Secondary color: #f1c40f (a vibrant orange)
	* Background color: #f9f9f9 (a neutral gray)
2. **Typography**:
	* Font family: Open Sans
	* Font sizes: 16px (body), 24px (header), 36px (title)
3. **Layout**:
	* Use a clean and minimalistic layout with ample whitespace.
	* Organize content into clear sections and use headings, subheadings, and bullet points to improve readability.
4. **Icons and Graphics**:
	* Use simple and recognizable icons, such as Font Awesome or Material Design Icons.
	* Incorporate graphics and illustrations that convey the platform's personality and tone, such as a stylized brain or a coding-themed pattern.

Overall, the CCO platform aims to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for vibe coders and clients alike. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and a user-centered design approach, the platform can streamline meeting productivity, automate note-taking, and facilitate the hiring process for clients.
