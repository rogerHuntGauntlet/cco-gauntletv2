**Project Summary**
The Chief Cognitive Officer (CCO) is an innovative tool designed for vibe coders who seek to streamline their workflow, enhance meeting productivity, and automate note-taking. By integrating a Zoom widget, the CCO provides real-time meeting management tips to help vibe coders close deals. Post-meeting, the CCO generates comprehensive meeting notes, a Product Requirements Document (PRD), and even initializes a code repository. The platform allows users to train their CCO by integrating various data sources, such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Twitter, email, and calendar. Additionally, the CCO enables clients to find and hire suitable vibe coders for their projects by interviewing and evaluating "Chief Cognitive Officers" through the platform.

	* Develop a machine learning model that analyzes user data and provides personalized recommendations for improving meeting productivity.
3. **Chief Cognitive Officer Evaluation**:
	* Develop a natural language processing (NLP) model that evaluates "Chief Cognitive Officers" based on their performance, skills, and experience.
	* Implement a rating system that allows clients to evaluate and hire vibe coders based on their performance.
4. **Platform Infrastructure**:
	* Design a scalable and secure platform infrastructure using cloud services such as AWS or Google Cloud.
	* Implement user authentication and authorization using OAuth and JWT.

**Design Aesthetic**

1. **Color Scheme**:
	* Primary color: #3498db (a calming blue)
